a very simple python3 script to fetch and play songs from [stereomood](http://www.stereomood.com).
requires [mpg123](http://www.mpg123.de)
stereomood is a cool music streaming service which generates playlists according to your mood, if you don't know already.

example usage (plays 'chillout' playlist):
    stereomood.py chillout

## TODO:
* check for alternative players (other than mpg123)
* add different playing modes (shuffle, repeat)
* add notification support (for [awesome wm](http://awesome.naquadah.org/)
* list available moods?
* play through random moods
* fetch continously
